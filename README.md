# React Router DOM v6 Nested Routes Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router DOM v6 related to unexpected routing behavior when nesting routes deeply.  Under certain conditions, routes within nested structures may not render as expected.

## Bug Description
The issue occurs when nesting routes within a complex hierarchy.  Sometimes, the nested routes fail to match properly, causing unexpected route behavior.  The exact cause seems to depend on the specifics of the route configuration and the nesting depth.   This bug causes incorrect component rendering for specific nested routes.

## How to Reproduce
Clone the repository and run `npm install`. Then, run `npm start`. Navigate through the nested routes. Note inconsistencies in rendering at different levels.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing route definitions and ensuring correct path configurations for nested routes.  Additional checks and potential adjustments to the routing structure might be required.  A clear explanation and correction of the faulty routing structure are provided in `NestedRoutesSolution.js`.
